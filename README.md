# AR-project01

Date: 26th July 2021

A simple Unity AR Core application that can spawn three different 3d objects on a plane using Addressable assets. 

The App has an interface to select the Object that should be placed in Augmented Reality. 

When the user scans the plane and taps it, the dynamic selected object gets instantiated on the plane.
